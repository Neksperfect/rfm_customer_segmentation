# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## Overview  
This project applies **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using an online retail dataset. By identifying key customer groups, the analysis helps businesses drive personalized marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## Objectives  
- Segment customers based on RFM metrics  
- Visualize customer behavior and patterns through data-driven insights  
- Enable targeted marketing and engagement strategies  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy** — Data preprocessing & manipulation  
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **Plotly**, **Dash** — Interactive dashboard development  
- **RFM Scoring** — Customer segmentation methodology  

## Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed raw transaction data from a UK-based online retailer  
2. **RFM Calculation**: Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer  
3. **Scoring & Segmentation**: Assigned RFM scores and grouped customers into segments (e.g., *Top Customers*, *At Risk*)  
4. **Dashboard Development**: Built an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to visualize and filter customer segments  

## Insights  
- **Top Customers**: Recent, frequent buyers with the highest monetary value  
- **Loyal Customers**: Repeat buyers who consistently make purchases over time  
- **Potential Customers**: New or moderate spenders who show promise of becoming loyal  
- **At-Risk Customers**: Previously active customers who haven't purchased in a while and may need re-engagement   

## Interactive Dashboard Features  
- Filter and explore customer segments  
- Visualize RFM distribution with dynamic charts  
- Gain behavioral insights to inform strategic decisions  

## Business Value  
This RFM-based segmentation approach enables businesses to:  
- Personalize communication and marketing efforts  
- Allocate resources efficiently across customer segments  
- Increase customer lifetime value through targeted lifecycle strategies
